Simple utility to sort photos and other files. This will place each file to target folder prefixed with directory YYYY-MM based on the file modification time. If there is same named file existing, then md5 will be calculated, and if they match the source file removed. In case the md5 does not match, then the file will be renamed (postfixed with "_%d").
